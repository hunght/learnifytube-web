![An illustration of a time tracking app](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddybeep-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/time_tracking_app_illustration.jpg-1741778033881.jpeg?alt=media&token=6d82408f-5358-40a2-b992-923e70a04f5a)

In reality, all the 5 reasons listed below usually do not apply to a single person. Many people will only see 2-3 reasons suitable with themselves, but that is more than enough to start looking for a time tracking app.

Now, here we go to the main part.

### Improve Productivity

First and foremost, a suitable time tracking software is meant to enhance productivity. Therefore, it is time to see in which level someone's performance is. Low, medium or high?

During a task or project, when having an app for time management, people are able to see the amount of time spent to complete. Through that, ineffective areas and processes are easily identified. Also, distractive things can be seen.

From here, solutions will be created. Maybe social media, irrelevant websites should be blocked to ensure 100% concentration. Maybe a particular action is taking more time than expected and it needs to be shortened, simplified or adjusted.

Besides, time tracking app that allows goals setting helps with motivation, thus levelling up the efficiency. When combining this with a self-reflection on performance regularly, the positive effects on productivity will surely follow.

### Assist In Project Management

Imagine that you are given 30 hours to complete a project with around 5 to 6 tasks. How are you going to prove to your boss or motivate yourself to finish each task within an acceptable time period? This is when project time management software steps in.

Doing so does not only give you a credible account on your work to show to others but also makes management easier. You have real numbers to estimate the viable amount of time for future projects.

Some time tracking apps like iTracksy also features a project board with cards. This is obviously made for project management as tasks can be classified, moved and tracked separately. The important thing is that you do not have to switch to another software, since it works like an upgraded Trello alternative.

### Create More Accurate Billings

Commonly, this will be popular for freelancers, specifically remote ones. When clients or employers ask for hourly rates and evidences, it becomes much easier because invoices can be generated.

While traditional time tracking apps do not include this feature since they are created for personal use. It is possible to find a bill generator incorporated in a Toggle or a free Toggl alternative, iTracksy (if you do not want to use all the money received for subscription).

Moreover, a owners are searching for time tracking software for small business as a way to embrace the new trend, remote working. Yet, it is essential to understand that using an app like that does not equal to micro management or controlling, since the aim is primarily to enhance the productivity.

Last but not least, this removes the fear of cheating. This is not a popular case, but some people might report that a task takes 10 hours to do while in fact, it is finished in 2 hours only with the aim to get 5x the money.

### Elevate Strategies On Time Management

Nowadays, methods like Pomodoro, time boxing, Eisenhower matrix, etc. are being widely applied because they are effective to many people. However, sometimes, it is difficult to commit to them and the reasons are many.

So, a time tracking with presets for such approaches can greatly help. It does not only motivate users to stick to it but also help block distractions like entertainment websites, thus boosting focus.

Additionally, a work time tracker like iTracksy, for example, provides presets that help people to instantly deploy those methods. That is surely more convenient than having to do that manually.

### Provide Data For Decision Making

This might sound irrelevant, but it is actually real. Which type of data can be gathered here? Time spent on a task, time spent on a project, actions taken during work, and similar things.

Management people, project managers surely love them since they are equipped with insights on how to improve productivity for the next times. For example, flaws in work processes and flows can be easily detected or even hiring decisions can be made if overloads are detected.

It also assists in allocating resources. In case a task consumes too much time and often blocks the progress, a support tool should be used or more humans should join it.

This does not benefit companies only. Even when you are a solo worker or freelancer, having the data to back for your decisions on productivity is mostly welcomed too.

## Who Will Benefit The Most From A Productivity Tracker?

Some particular audiences along with the advantages they receive will be discussed below.

### Remote Workers/ Freelancers

Even though remote working has become a trend, a majority of companies choose to pay hourly rather than monthly. So, it is apparent that having a time tracking app will help in deciding the salary.

For freelancers, it is always about the hours spent on work. Having a proof will prevent unnecessary conflicts from happening. Apart from that, when having the data on how the performance looks, maximizing the productivity to get more jobs, finish more tasks at a shorter time becomes a piece of cake.

Like in iTracksy, analytics are available, thus allowing you to showcase your real productivity in a credible way and so, clients will follow.

For owners, having a summary of how employees work is much more comfortable than looking and dealing with a manual timesheet. The team and resources will be easier to balance and distribute with the aim to enhance productivity, reduce time wasting.

### Outsourcing Companies

For outsourcing companies, the charges are conducted in a hourly basis which means that it is a must to have a time tracking app. This requirement will also come from the client's side as well since they need something to rely on. As a result, your transparency and credibility are increased.

Moreover, it also eliminates vague billing and invoices at the end of the day, thus ensuring benefits for both outsourcing units and people hiring them.

### Firms Charging Hourly Rates

This is a little bit niche as there are only specific industries containing this type of companies like architecture, law, consultancy. Ideally, those firms' invoices are based on the number of hours put into work.

Again, deploying a time tracking software eventually comforts the customers that they will not be deceived and pay in accordance to the efforts, no more or less. Hence, trust and transparency are boosted.
