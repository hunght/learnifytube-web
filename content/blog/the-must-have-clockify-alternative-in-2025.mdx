[Clockify](https://clockify.me/) has garnered a large user base, particularly among freelancers and small teams. Its promise of a truly free plan with unlimited users is a major draw. But like any software, it has its pros and cons.

Before meeting the Clockify alternative, let's go through the app first to determine if it is worth considering a change.

### **Strengths**

One of Clockify's biggest strengths is its generous [free plan](https://clockify.me/pricing). It allows unlimited users and projects, making it a cost-effective solution for teams. It also offers detailed reporting, project budgeting, and a wide range of integrations with other productivity tools.

Therefore, if someone is seeking a simple timesheet software with a strong free offering, Clockify is often a top recommendation.



### **Weaknesses**

While feature-rich, [Clockify's interface](https://connecteam.com/reviews/clockify/) can sometimes feel a bit cluttered or less intuitive for some users. Navigating through the various sections and customizing reports might require a bit of a learning curve. This creates a major drawback as a time tracking app does not require you to spend unnecessary time on it.
