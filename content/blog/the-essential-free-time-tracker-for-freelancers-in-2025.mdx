### Features That Cannot Go Missing In A Hour Tracking App

Obviously, a basic remote worker time tracker **must include hour logging, report and analytics generation and invoice creation**. It is recommended to keep in mind that not every time tracking software are meant for freelancers, thus not having invoice generation or other needed features.
