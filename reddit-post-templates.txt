REDDIT POST TEMPLATES - READY TO USE
=====================================

TEMPLATE 1: Problem-Solution Post (BEST FOR LAUNCH)
------------------------------------------------------

Title: Tired of getting distracted while learning on YouTube? I built a free tool to download and organize educational content offline

Body:
Hey [subreddit]!

I've been struggling with YouTube's distractions when trying to learn - ads interrupting my flow, endless recommendations pulling me away, and needing constant internet connection. As a student/learner, this was really frustrating.

So I built LearnifyTube - a free, open-source tool that lets you:
• Download videos, entire playlists, transcripts, and subtitles with one click
• Organize everything with tags, notes, and timestamps (your own searchable learning library)
• Learn offline anywhere - no internet needed
• All data stays on your device (privacy-first, no accounts, no tracking)

It's completely free and open source. Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this better for your learning workflow?

Happy to answer any questions!

Title: Show HN: LearnifyTube - Open-source YouTube downloader built for learners

Body:
I've been working on LearnifyTube for the past few months and wanted to share it with the community.

It's a learning-first YouTube downloader that focuses on:
• Privacy (all data local, no accounts, no telemetry)

• Open source (MIT license)

Built with Electron, React, and yt-dlp under the hood.

Why I built it: I was frustrated trying to learn from YouTube - too many distractions, ads, and needing internet everywhere. So I built a tool specifically for learners who want to build their own offline knowledge library.

Perfect for:
- Students saving lectures before exams
- Teachers creating lesson plans
- Bootcamp learners collecting tutorials
- Knowledge workers building research vaults

TEMPLATE 3: Educational Focus (r/learnprogramming, r/college)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Title: How I organize 500+ hours of YouTube tutorials into a searchable learning library

Body:
I've been learning programming from YouTube for years, but keeping everything organized was a nightmare. Playlists would disappear, I'd forget which video had that one solution, and I couldn't study offline.

So I built LearnifyTube to solve this. Here's how it works:

1. **Download Everything**: Videos, playlists, transcripts, subtitles - all in one click
2. **Organize with Tags**: Tag by subject, difficulty, language, whatever makes sense
3. **Add Notes & Timestamps**: Pin important moments, add study notes
4. **Search Everything**: Find any video, note, or timestamp instantly
5. **Learn Offline**: Take your entire library anywhere

It's completely free, open source, and privacy-focused (all data stays on your device).

Perfect for:
- Saving coding bootcamp playlists
- Organizing lecture series
- Building your personal knowledge base
- Studying offline during commutes
