## 📝 CONTENT STRATEGY (The 4 Pillars)

### Pillar 1: "Build in Public" (Trust & Tech Cred)
*Target: #TechTwitter, #OpenSource*
- Share screenshots of code, new features in progress, or bug fixes.
- Discuss technical challenges (e.g., "How we handled YouTube's API rate limits locally").
- **Format:** "Just shipped [Feature]! Here's how we built it using [Tech Stack]. 🧵"

### Pillar 2: Educational Curation (Authority)
*Target: #StudyTwt, #100DaysOfCode*
- Curate lists of best learning channels.
- **Format:** "Top 5 YouTube Channels to learn React in 2025 🧵" (At the end, mention: "Download these ad-free with LearnifyTube").
- **Format:** "How to actually remember what you watch on YouTube. The active recall method: [Explanation]..."

## 💬 ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (The "Cocktail Party" Rule)

**Don't just shout. Mingle.**

### 1. The "Helpful Reply"
- Search for: "download youtube videos", "youtube distractions", "best way to take notes on videos".
- **Reply:** "Hey! If you're looking to focus, I built an open-source tool called LearnifyTube that removes ads and lets you take notes. Might help! [Link]"
- **Rule:** Be helpful, not spammy. If they asked for a downloader, it's relevant. If they asked about Netflix, it's not.

### 2. The "Creator Tag"
- When you curate content (Pillar 2), tag the creators.
- "Just watched an amazing tutorial by @TraversyMedia. Used LearnifyTube to take notes on the key React hooks. Highly recommend his channel!"
- **Why:** Creators might retweet to their audience.

### 3. Smart Lists
- Create public lists: "Best Coding Educators", "Study Motivation".
- Add people to them. They get a notification. It puts you on their radar.
