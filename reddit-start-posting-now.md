## 📍 Where to Post Right Now

### Option 1: r/learnprogramming (Best for Start)

**Step 1:** Go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/new/

**Step 2:** Look for questions about:
- "How to organize tutorials"
- "Learning workflow"
- "Study tips"
- "YouTube tutorials"
- "Organizing learning materials"

**Step 3:** Click on a question that has few or no answers

**Step 4:** Use this response template:

```
I've found that organizing tutorials by topic and difficulty level works really well. Here's what I do:

1. **Create folders by subject** - I organize by language/framework (e.g., "React Basics", "Advanced React", "Node.js")

2. **Tag videos with key concepts** - I keep a simple text file noting what each tutorial covers

3. **Use consistent naming** - Format like "Subject - Topic - Date" makes it easy to find things later

4. **Download playlists for offline viewing** - This helps me focus without distractions and build a personal learning library I can reference anytime

5. **Keep notes at important timestamps** - When I find a key concept, I note the timestamp so I can jump back to it

The key is making it easy to find what you need when you need it. What subject are you learning? I might have more specific tips!

### Option 2: r/productivity

**Step 1:** Go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/new/

**Step 2:** Look for questions about:
- "Organizing videos"
- "Learning organization"
- "Study tools"
- "Offline learning"

**Step 3:** Click on a relevant question

**Step 4:** Use this response template:

```
I use a simple system that works really well:

**Digital Organization:**
- One folder per subject/course
- Consistent naming convention: "Subject - Topic - Date"
- Keep a master index file with links and notes

**For Video Content:**
- Download playlists for offline access (removes distractions)
- Add timestamps for important sections
- Create a simple text file with key takeaways from each video

**Review System:**
- Weekly review of what you've learned
- Build projects to apply knowledge
- Keep everything searchable

The key is making it easy to find what you need when you need it. I find that having everything organized locally (not just bookmarked) makes a huge difference in actually using the content.

What are you trying to organize? I might have more specific tips!
