Product Hunt First Comment
==========================

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm super excited to share LearnifyTube with you today!

As a student and lifelong learner, I was constantly frustrated by YouTube's distractions - ads interrupting my flow, endless recommendations pulling me away, and the need for constant internet connection. So I built LearnifyTube to solve exactly that problem.

Here's what makes it special:

🎯 **Built for Learning, Not Just Downloading**
Unlike generic YouTube downloaders, LearnifyTube is designed specifically for learners. You can tag videos by subject, group them into courses, pin important timestamps, and add study notes - turning your downloads into a searchable knowledge library.

📚 **One-Click Everything**
Download videos, entire playlists, transcripts, and subtitles in over 100 languages - all with a single click. Perfect for saving that entire coding bootcamp or lecture series before your next study session.

🔒 **Privacy-First & Free**
All your data stays on your device. No accounts, no tracking, no telemetry. And it's completely free and open source.

I'd love to hear from you:
- What's your biggest pain point when learning from YouTube?
- Are you a student, teacher, or self-learner? How would you use this?
- What features would make your learning workflow even better?

I'm here all day to answer questions and hear your feedback. Let's make learning from YouTube better together! 🚀

ALTERNATIVE VERSION (More Casual)
==================================

Hey PH! 🚀

Super pumped to launch LearnifyTube today - it's the YouTube downloader I wish existed when I was in college.

The problem? YouTube is amazing for learning, but terrible for actually learning. Ads, distractions, and needing internet everywhere. So I built LearnifyTube to fix that.

What you get:
✅ Download videos, playlists, transcripts - everything in one click
✅ Organize with tags, notes, and timestamps (your own personal learning library)
✅ Works offline anywhere
✅ 100% free, open source, and privacy-focused (no accounts, no tracking)

I'm curious - how do you currently learn from YouTube? What would make it better for you?

Drop your thoughts below, and let's chat! I'll be here all day answering questions. 🙌
